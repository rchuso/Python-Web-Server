	<body>
		<p>This template gets all the content from the header of the requested .html file, but also (below here) requests all the content in the "fred" element.
		When the server reads the requested .html file, it will scan that file for the first "fred" element and substitute that here in the template and return the "wrapped" content.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this case, all the content of the requested .html file that's not inside the "fred" element will be ignored and not sent to the user.
		I suppose that if I wanted to I could make a DTD with additional elements, but that would actually be more restrictive than this simple solution.
