		<h4>This header is in the template.</h4>
		<p>This template allows all the .html content in this folder to be "wrapped" with the same look and feel without duplicating things like header, footer, menu, &amp;c.
		</p>
		<p>The server checks to see if a "template.html" file exists in the folder and uses that.
		If there is no such file, the file will be served as is.
		</p>
		<p>The template uses a "template" tag to reference (with an "id") the tag in the requested .html file, and includes the referenced content as a replacement.
		This page includes a "template" tag in the header with an "id='head'", which will include all the elements in the "head" of the requested .html file.
		It also includes a "template" tag with "id='body'" here, and the server will substitute everything in the "body" element from the requested file.
