			<p>These buttons test the AJAX ability of the AkA.js script.
			The buttons in this table all have a "class='loadAkA'" which is the key to the AkA class to examine and possibly modify the attributes.
			If the attributes do not include the "href" (not usually included with button) they will be ignored.
			This is the case with the zeroth one - it has the "class" and an "id" but no "href".
			</p>
			<p>The first one has no "id", so one is generated for it.
			Because of this reference, the return .json content will be substituted as the ".innerHTML" for this button.
			The second one has all the used attributes, so the returned .json content will be used as the new text on the button.
			The third one is also missing an "id", but it has a "dest" attribute (not normal with button), and that will be used as the recipient of the returned .json content.
			In this case, the "dest" references the previous button, and that one will get the returned content.
			The fourth one has an "onclick='myTurn()'" function but no "id".
			An "id" will be generated for it, and the response from the server will be passed to this function, together with the generated "id".
			In this case, the supplied function replaces the button text with the returned data.
			Of course, the returned .json file could contain other instructions for the "myTurn" script.

				<p>The following header element will be replaced by the button.
				The "onclick" of these buttons reference the "AkALink" function directly with their parameters.
				This could be done by the script directly (as that's the same function that would be dynamically created), but that choice is left to the developer.
